## Project Philosophy

**KISS - Keep It Simple, Stupid**

This project is opinionated and minimal:
- One way to do things (no options)
- Make-driven (no manual commands)
- Automatic dependencies (no setup steps)
- Zero configuration (sensible defaults)

## Key Principles

1. **Makefile Does Everything**: All setup, login, config creation is handled automatically via Makefile dependencies
2. **No Options**: Device code flow only, 0 ACU auto-pause only, us-west-1 only
3. **Sensible Defaults**: Everything pre-configured for maximum cost savings
4. **No Extra Docs**: README.md is the only user-facing documentation

## Project Overview

AWS infrastructure management with:
- Terraform infrastructure-as-code
- Containerized dev environment (Podman/Docker)
- Device code authentication (paste URL in browser)
- Current configuration: Aurora Serverless v2 with 0 ACU auto-pause

## User Workflow

```bash
make init     # Auto-builds, auto-login, auto-config
make apply    # Deploy infrastructure
make connect  # Connect to database (if deployed)
```

Or just:
```bash
make apply  # Everything automatic - wake up and deploy
```

No manual build, no manual login, no manual infrastructure setup.

## Technical Details

### Automatic Dependencies

- `.container-built` - Tracks container build state, rebuilds when Dockerfile/aws-login.sh changes
- `.aws-login` - PHONY target that ALWAYS checks AWS auth, prompts for device code if expired
- `terraform.tfvars` - Auto-created from example on first use
- `~/.aws/config` - Auto-created with us-west-1 region

### Critical Design Decisions

**1. `.aws-login` must be PHONY**
- NOT a file-based dependency - it's a PHONY target
- Always runs the auth check, even if `.aws-login` file exists
- Handles session expiration automatically
- The `aws-login.sh` script does the actual credential check

**2. Container build is dependency-based**
- `.container-built` file tracks build state
- Depends on `Dockerfile` and `aws-login.sh`
- Rebuilds automatically when either changes
- Cached otherwise for speed

**3. Single command to deploy**
- `make apply` handles everything: build → login → deploy
- Extracts outputs from Terraform state
- No manual copy/paste of values
- Works after waking up with expired session

### Cost Optimization (Current Aurora Setup)

- `serverless_min_capacity = 0` - Enables automatic pause
- `seconds_until_auto_pause = 300` - 5 minutes idle before pause
- `serverless_max_capacity = 1` - Low ceiling for dev
- Result: ~$5-15/month instead of ~$45/month

## AWS SSO Authentication

**Critical Lessons from Implementation:**

1. **SSO Session Format is Required**
   - Must use `[sso-session]` block in `~/.aws/config`
   - Device code flow (`--no-browser`) doesn't work with all SSO setups
   - PKCE flow (browser-based) is the reliable method

2. **Region Must Match SSO Region**
   - `sso_region` must match where your IAM Identity Center is deployed
   - Using wrong region causes `InvalidRequestException` errors

3. **SSO Configuration Structure**
   ```
   [sso-session default-sso]
   sso_start_url = https://d-xxxxxxxxxx.awsapps.com/start
   sso_region = us-west-1
   sso_registration_scopes = sso:account:access

   [profile default]
   sso_session = default-sso
   sso_account_id = 928413605543
   sso_role_name = AdministratorAccess
   region = us-west-1
   ```

4. **Container Authentication Flow**
   - AWS CLI must run on HOST for browser-based auth (PKCE flow)
   - Container accesses cached credentials in `~/.aws/`
   - Install AWS CLI via Homebrew: `brew install awscli`
   - Login on host: `aws sso login --profile default`
   - Container reads from mounted `~/.aws:/root/.aws:ro`

5. **Common Pitfalls**
   - ❌ Device code flow with `#/device` URLs - often fails
   - ❌ Running AWS CLI only in container - can't open browser
   - ✅ Browser-based PKCE flow on host - reliable
   - ✅ Mount ~/.aws as read-only in container

## When Working on This Project

### Do:
- **ALWAYS use Makefile commands** - `make init`, `make apply`, `make destroy`, `make fmt`, etc.
- Keep the Makefile simple and automatic
- Use Makefile dependencies for prerequisites
- Make auth checks PHONY so they always run
- Maintain single opinionated way to do things
- Keep README.md concise
- Test "wake up" scenario (expired sessions)
- **Prefer Makefile targets over direct CLI commands** for reproducibility

### Don't:
- Add options or alternatives
- Create extra documentation files
- Add manual setup steps
- Make users think about configuration
- Cache auth state without re-checking (breaks session expiration)
- **Run raw commands when a Makefile target exists** - use `make` instead
- **NEVER add Claude Code attribution to git commits** - no "Generated with Claude Code" or "Co-Authored-By: Claude" in commit messages

### Common Pitfalls

**File-based auth tracking**: Don't do `touch .aws-login` without making it PHONY. Sessions expire but files don't.

**Container build caching**: Do track build state with `.container-built` file. Rebuilding every time is slow.

**Manual setup steps**: Don't make users copy/paste values. Extract from Terraform state automatically.

## Common Tasks

**Add a new Terraform variable**:
1. Add to `variables.tf` with sensible default
2. Add to `terraform.tfvars.example`
3. Update README.md if user needs to change it

**Change authentication**:
Don't. Device code flow is the only way.

**Add alternative regions**:
Don't. us-west-1 is the choice.

**Add deployment options**:
Don't. 0 ACU auto-pause is the way.

## Philosophy in Action

User says: "I want options for..."
Answer: No. One opinionated way.

User says: "Can I use access keys instead of SSO?"
Answer: No. Device code flow only.

User says: "I want to configure..."
Answer: Makefile handles it automatically.

The goal is zero decisions, zero configuration, maximum simplicity.
